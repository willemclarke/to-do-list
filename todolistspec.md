Todo list app spec:

I want an app I can run from the command line to help me manage my list of tasks for the day. 

When I run it, it should give me 5 commands I can run:

Listing todo items. Each todo item will have a description, and an ID. The ID will be autogenerated. We use this to identify todo items so we can complete, uncomplete and delete them

node todo.js list

Add todo item. Just takes in a description

node todo.js add "Clean the house"

Delete todo item using the ID (you get the ID by listing)

node todo.js delete 1

Mark todo item as completed, using the ID (you get the ID by listing)

node todo.js complete 1

Mark todo item as not completed (if you need to unmark something as completed basicaly), using the ID (you get the ID by listing)

node todo.js uncomplete 1

You will obviously need to come up with some way to save your todo lists to disk, so they persist through restarting the app. I would save all your todo items in a JSON object. This link might help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36856232/write-add-data-in-json-file-using-node-js

Use whatever libraries you want (inquirer etc), or none at all.
